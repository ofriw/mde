# Terminal Color Accessibility Assessment

## Summary
Our current implementation uses ANSI 16-color codes, which aligns with best practices for terminal applications. However, there are several areas where we could improve contrast ratios and accessibility.

## Current Color Usage Analysis

### Strengths ✅

1. **Using Standard ANSI 16-color palette**
   - We correctly use colors 0-15, which are universally supported
   - Terminal emulators can customize these colors for user preferences
   - No hardcoded RGB values that would override user settings

2. **No forced 24-bit colors**
   - We avoid 8-bit or 24-bit color codes that bypass user preferences
   - This respects users who have customized their terminal palette

3. **Simple, predictable color assignments**
   - Headings use bright colors with bold
   - Comments use gray (bright black)
   - Strings use green
   - Keywords use magenta

### Weaknesses ❌

1. **No contrast ratio validation**
   - We don't ensure WCAG-compliant contrast ratios
   - Some color combinations may be problematic:
     - Gray text (color 8) on dark backgrounds
     - Yellow (color 3) on light backgrounds
     - Blue links (color 4) may have poor contrast

2. **No accessibility options**
   - No support for `$NO_COLOR` environment variable
   - No high-contrast mode option
   - No way to disable colors for users who prefer plain text

3. **Potential color blindness issues**
   - Red/green distinctions (headings vs strings)
   - Blue/magenta distinctions (links vs keywords)
   - No alternative indicators beyond color

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements

1. **Respect `$NO_COLOR` environment variable**
   ```go
   func shouldUseColor() bool {
       return os.Getenv("NO_COLOR") == ""
   }
   ```

2. **Use brighter colors for better contrast**
   - Change comments from ColorGray (8) to ColorBrightWhite (15)
   - Use ColorBrightBlue (12) instead of ColorBlue (4) for links
   - Ensure all text colors have sufficient contrast

3. **Add semantic indicators beyond color**
   - Keep markdown prefixes visible (##, >, -, etc.)
   - Use formatting (bold, underline) in addition to color
   - Consider unicode symbols for enhanced readability

### Color Mapping Improvements

Current problematic mappings:
```go
// POOR CONTRAST
ColorGray (8) for comments - too dark on black backgrounds
ColorBlue (4) for links - insufficient contrast
ColorYellow (3) for numbers - poor on white backgrounds

// BETTER ALTERNATIVES
ColorBrightWhite (15) or ColorWhite (7) for comments
ColorBrightBlue (12) or ColorCyan (6) for links  
ColorBrightYellow (11) for numbers
```

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Add `$NO_COLOR` support
   - Fix gray comment visibility
   - Improve link contrast

2. **Medium Priority**  
   - Add configuration for high-contrast mode
   - Test with common color blindness simulators
   - Document color accessibility features

3. **Low Priority**
   - Add alternative visual indicators
   - Create accessibility testing suite
   - Support custom color mappings

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with popular terminal themes:
   - Solarized (light and dark)
   - Dracula
   - One Dark
   - Terminal.app defaults
   - Windows Terminal defaults

2. Validate contrast ratios:
   - Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
   - Minimum 3:1 for large/bold text
   - Use APCA for more accurate predictions

3. Test accessibility scenarios:
   - With `NO_COLOR=1`
   - High contrast terminal themes
   - Color blindness simulators
   - Screen readers (where applicable)

## Conclusion

While our use of standard ANSI colors is correct, we need to improve contrast ratios and add accessibility features. The most critical issues are gray text visibility and lack of `$NO_COLOR` support.
