# History

## 2025-07-14
Completed the foundation and basic editor implementation:
- Created main.go with Bubble Tea initialization
- Implemented Model with editor state management
- Added text editing capabilities with cursor movement
- Implemented file loading from command line args and saving with Ctrl+S
- Added status bar showing filename, modified state, and cursor position
- Added help bar showing key commands (^O Open, ^S Save, ^Q Quit)
- Set up proper Go module structure with internal/tui package
- Configured linting with .golangci.yml

Note: Ctrl+O open file dialog is stubbed - shows message "Open file functionality coming soon". This can be enhanced in a future ticket to add a file browser or prompt for filename input.

**Status: COMPLETED**
All tasks completed successfully. The editor now has a working foundation with basic text editing capabilities.
