# History

## 2025-07-14
Successfully implemented core markdown parsing and syntax highlighting:
- ✅ Added goldmark dependency to project
- ✅ Implemented CommonMarkParser plugin with full syntax highlighting support
- ✅ Added markdown-specific token types (heading, bold, italic, code, links, etc.)
- ✅ Extended theme system with markdown element styling
- ✅ Integrated parser with terminal renderer for syntax highlighting
- ✅ Connected parsing pipeline to TUI for real-time highlighting
- ✅ Fixed architectural issues (import cycles) between plugin and AST systems
- ✅ Added comprehensive regex-based markdown element detection
- ✅ Implemented line-by-line token parsing for performance

**Current Status**: Core markdown parsing and syntax highlighting functional. 
**Remaining work**: Preview mode implementation and parsing optimizations.

## 2025-07-14 (continued)
Successfully implemented preview mode functionality:
- ✅ Added preview mode toggle (Ctrl+P) to TUI
- ✅ Implemented markdown to HTML conversion using goldmark
- ✅ Added HTML to terminal-friendly text conversion

- ✅ Connected preview mode with existing editor navigation
- ✅ All tests passing, build successful

**Current Status**: Preview mode implementation complete - users can toggle between editor and preview modes with Ctrl+P.
**Remaining work**: Parsing optimizations for large documents.

## 2025-07-14 (final optimization)
Successfully implemented parsing optimizations for large documents:
- ✅ Added viewport-based parsing for documents > 1000 lines
- ✅ Implemented lazy markdown rendering for documents > 50KB
- ✅ Added buffer-based parsing (50 lines above/below viewport)
- ✅ Optimized preview mode with incremental rendering
- ✅ Added separate parsing methods for small vs large documents
- ✅ Maintained smooth scrolling performance with buffered parsing
- ✅ Preserved full functionality while improving performance
- ✅ All tests passing, build successful
